              <h2>Code is created by people</h2>

              <p>There are many in my field who have hard-line opinions about the supremacy of one language over another, one syntax over another, one framework over another, etc.</p>

              <p>Some people hate Javascript for its loose approach to interpretation, PHP for its clunky code, Ruby for its opacity and speed, Java or C# for their layers and layers of classes and interfaces. I'm not like that.</p>

              <p>To me, it all boils down to people making choices and then working with those choices.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>SASS or LESS?</li>
                <li>HAML or ERB?</li>
                <li>AngularJS or EmberJS?</li>
                <li>PHP or Java or C#?</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Usually, decisions on any of these technologies were made years ago and have been grandfathered in.</p>

              <p>Every generation of technology seems to make moves that are in some ways more liberating and in other ways more confining.</p>

              <h2>Interfaces</h2>
              <p>I build websites for a living, and that ultimately means that I build interfaces for a living.</p>
              <p>My goal is always clean code because that means that <b>the people</b> maintaining, generating, or viewing the interfaces will live more satisfying lives.</p>
              <p>Usually, that means intentional tagging, consistent class and id conventions, limited node-depth, and clean interfacing with libraries, frameworks, scripts, and microdata interfaces.</p>

              <h2>Content Management</h2>
              <p>Ultimately, web devs often have to hand off their work to collaborators who know far less about code than they do.</p>
              <p>This is the cause of much hand-wringing among developers who really have a hard time translating their work, and who are terrified that someone can break their layouts out of ignorance.</p>
              <p>It's not always easy, but a smooth hand-off and easy training of the content manager is the ultimate success of my work.</p>
              <p>It means that I understand my own code, and I have anticipated how to maintain that code in terms of the people who will maintain it.</p>

              <h2>Frameworks and MV systems</h2>
              <p>MV* is one of the areas of development most difficult to communicate to non-tech people, but it is nonetheless essential to making the sort of intuitive, flexible systems people have grown to rely upon.</p>
              <p>Want a website that pulls in the latest weather? allows you to upload or search youtube videos? lets you get stock price updates, or simply lets you manage your own information from anywhere, using your phone, tablet, whatever?</p>
              <p>Sometimes, you just need a plain-jane html/css/js website, but quite often nowadays, people really want applications that do real stuff, really easily, and to do this, frameworks are where it's at.</p>

              <p>I am a front-end developer who strives to be full-stack.</p>

              <p>Ultimately, the back-end and server are the hidden foundations that we all rely upon but precious few understand deeply.</p>
              <p>Back-end development requires a great ability to anticipate the demands put on an application, and the ability to build in anticipation of and response to those challenges.</p>
              <p>My work in server-side technology is pragmatic, in that I have learned through practice to configure and troubleshoot servers via terminal.</p>
              <p>I have a workable knowledge of OO, Functional programming, and scope in multiple languages.</p>

              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, where I loved to wander through the neighborhoods and do art and creative projects such as "how to cross Sepulveda Blvd on foot" and "where am I supposed to park in Westwood Village?". I went to some of the finest schools in the area, then gave up and moved to the East Coast.</p>
              <p>At Boston University, I learned how to navigate a city with an established public and regional transit systems (plus the all-important Chinatown bus), and snow. I learned about music, film, the arts, and how to buy food at the supermarket.</p>
              <p>Later, I moved to New York and commuted to NYC from White Plains, where I learned about suburban life, discovered my love for wall-climbing, and began my education in web development with HTML4, CSS, Flash, and Dreamweaver.</p>
              <p>Then I travelled to New Zealand, explored the outdoors, and then moved to Columbus, Ohio, where I gained real-world experience sitting at a desk pumping out websites, and gave the snow one last try.</p>
              <p>I finally gave winters the finger and moved back to Los Angeles, where I started a family and now reside in Santa Monica.</p>
