              <h2>Code is created by people</h2>

              <p>There are many in my field who have hard-line opinions about the supremacy of one language over another, one syntax over another, one framework over another, etc.</p>

              <p>Some people hate Javascript for its loose approach to interpretation, PHP for its clunky code, Ruby for the opacity of its gems and its speed issues, Java or C# for their layers and layers of classes and interfaces. I'm not like that.</p>

              <p>To me, it all boils down to people making choices and then working with those choices.</p>

              <h2>Interfaces</h2>
              <p>I build websites for a living, and that means that I build interfaces that people use.</p>
              <p>My goal is always clean code because that means that <em>the people</em> maintaining, generating, or viewing the interfaces will live more satisfying lives.</p>
              <p>Usually, that means intentional tagging, consistent class and id conventions, limited node-depth, and clean interfacing with libraries, frameworks, scripts, and microdata interfaces.</p>

              <h2>Content Management</h2>
              <p>Web devs often have to hand off their work to collaborators who know far less about code than they do.</p>
              <p>This is the cause of much hand-wringing among developers whose work doesn't easily translate to English, and who are terrified that someone can break their work out of ignorance.</p>
              <p>Working with a client, my greatest success is a smooth hand-off of an intuitive content management experience to the client.</p>
              <p>If I've done my job right, I understand my own code, and I have anticipated how the client will maintain it.</p>

              <h2>Frameworks and MV systems</h2>
              <p>MV* is one of the areas of development most difficult to communicate to non-tech people, but it is nonetheless essential to many contemporary projects.</p>
              <p>Want a website that pulls in the latest weather? allows you to upload or search youtube videos? lets you get stock price updates, or simply lets you manage your own information from anywhere, using your phone, tablet, whatever?</p>
              <p>The effective selection and application of a framework for a project's needs is a task that requires careful consideration, close involvement of the client, and mastery of the separation of concerns.</p>

              <p>I am a front-end developer who strives to be full-stack.</p>
              <p>I have tremendous respect for the engineers and developers who build complex systems, find clever solutions for security, stability, code reuse, efficiency, and hardware acceleration.</p>
              <p>The back-end and server are the hidden foundations that we all rely upon but precious few understand deeply.</p>
              <p>Back-end development requires a great ability to anticipate the demands put on an application, and the ability to build in anticipation of and response to those challenges.</p>
              <p>My work in server-side technology is pragmatic, in that I have learned through practice to configure and troubleshoot servers via terminal.</p>
              <p>I have a working knowledge of OOP and functional programming, and I have a grasp of scope and syntax in multiple languages.</p>

              <h2>Version Control</h2>
              <p>Version control is the ultimate test of a development team.</p>
              <p>Within version control systems, there is the opportunity for team members to greatly enhance or hinder their colleagues' work.</p>
              <p>A conscientious developer makes commits clean and logical so that changes can be tracked gracefully, and repaired without creating timelines that look like a cracked smartphone screen.</p>
              <p>A well-run development team will branch and version projects consistently so that updates can be made when needed, and individual developers can work locally with utmost confidence.</p>

              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, where I loved to wander through the neighborhoods and do art and creative projects such as "how to cross Sepulveda Blvd on foot" and "where am I supposed to park in Westwood Village?". I went to some of the finest schools in the area, then gave up and moved to the East Coast.</p>
              <p>At Boston University, I learned how to navigate a city with an established public and regional transit systems (plus the all-important Chinatown bus), and snow. I learned about music, film, the arts, and how to buy food at the supermarket.</p>
              <p>Later, I moved to New York and commuted to NYC from White Plains, where I learned about suburban life, discovered my love for wall-climbing, and began my education in web development with HTML4, CSS, Flash, and Dreamweaver.</p>
              <p>Then I travelled to New Zealand, explored the outdoors; then moved to Columbus, Ohio, where I gained real-world experience sitting at a desk pumping out websites. I gave the snow one last try, and then ditched muddy windshield wipers for a return to Southern California.</p>
              <p>Back in Los Angeles, I started a family and now reside in Santa Monica with my 2 wife and 2 mind-breakingly amazing kids.</p>
