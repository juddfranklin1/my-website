#Welcome to my personal website.

__The master branch of this repo is my legacy website.__
It contains more than a few "experimental" features. I have left it here to reflect my desire to experiment, try things, and explore technologies.

The active branch of this repository is *dev-gatsby*. This branch, as it's name suggests, is a Gatsby-driven static site. The content management of that site is handled by Contentful.

Eventually, the site will house my blog, some more concrete code samples, etc.
